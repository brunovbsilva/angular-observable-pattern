# Observable Pattern

Observable pattern, also known as publish-subscribe pattern, is a design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
In this project, I demonstrate how to implement this pattern in Angular using RxJS by applyed it on toast notifications.
